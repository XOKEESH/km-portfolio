        <p>
          I'm a UX Designer and Software Engineer with a creative and technical background that's anything but typical. My passion lies in bridging design and development to craft thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences.

        <p>
          Outside of work, I'm a community builder, hosting and teaching sewing workshopsâ€”a rewarding way to share my love for design with fellow creatives. I also enjoy exploring art galleries, attending creative workshops, discovering new restaurants, and listening to music. Life stays fun and entertaining thanks to my two dogs, Kniko, a Boston Terrier, and Stormi, a French Bulldog.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I'm excited to collaborate on projects that push boundaries, create impact, and bring people closer to what matters.
