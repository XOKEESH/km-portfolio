      <h2>Dreamer, Creative, and Lover of the Arts</h2>
      <p>I'm a UX Designer and Software Engineer with a creative and technical background that's anything but typical. I started my career in fashion design, where I launched my own brand, served as a Creative Director for other brands, and even had the chance to work with big names and celebrities. Alongside these roles, I also held positions in management, sales, and customer service, building a solid foundation in leadership, communication, and customer experience.<br/>
      In 2022, I earned a UX Design certificate from General Assembly, with a full scholarship from Microsoft, which deepened my passion for creating thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences. Now, I'm focused on bridging design and development, using my combined skill set to build products that truly meet users' needs. <br/>
      Outside of work, I'm often building community by hosting & teaching sewing workshopsâ€”sharing my love for sewing and design with other creatives has been incredibly rewarding. I also love exploring art galleries, attending creative workshops, finding new restaurants, and listening to music. My two dogs, Kniko, a Boston Terrier, and Stormi, a French Bulldog, keep life fun and always entertaining.<br/>
      I'm excited to collaborate on projects that push boundaries, create impact, and bring people closer to what matters.</p>
