      <p>
        These are my core design values, and I strive to embody them in every project I take on. 
        Design is more than solving problems â€” it's about creating solutions that inspire, connect, 
        and empower. I approach my work with empathy, always putting users first, while drawing on 
        creativity and collaboration to uncover innovative possibilities. By continuously learning 
        and growing, I stay adaptable and ready to meet new challenges. Above all, I ground my 
        process in integrity, ensuring my work is thoughtful, impactful, and meaningful.
