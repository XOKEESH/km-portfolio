        <p>These are my core design values, and I strive to imbue them in all of the work I do. I've always been making things and inventing ways to improve my surroundings. Solving a tangible need with a beautiful solution is a practice I love and resides in my core. Collaborating with a team to create a far better outcome than otherwise possible alone gives me energy. I like thinking big, working fast, yet carefully, holistically, long-term, sustainably, cross-functionally, zooming out on company strategy, and zooming in on details. I'm always improving, growing, and executing to the highest standard possible. All while achieving a larger mission, connecting my work to something deeper, tethered to improving the world, leaving it better than when I began.</p>
