        <p>I studied visual communication design, got my start in branding, marketing, and web design, then evolved to specialize in product design. Leveraging my visual design foundation and deep user empathy, I've established myself as a well rounded design leader who creates human-centered platforms with cohesive throughlines at every touchpoint: from vision and strategy, to brand awareness and marketing, to product development and delightful micro interactions. Throughout my 15 years of professional experience, I've worked freelance, in-house, at startups, and at established public companies, developing a wide range of multi-disciplinary skills in diverse contexts. My insatiable curiosity, high craft, and adaptability, enable me to generate impact in our ever-changing environment.</p>
